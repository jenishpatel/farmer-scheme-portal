## üåæ About The Project

**AgriPortal** is a comprehensive, user-centric web application designed to bridge the information gap for farmers in the digital age. It directly tackles the challenge many farmers face in accessing and applying for beneficial government aid schemes. The platform provides a centralized, intuitive interface for farmers to discover opportunities, while also offering a powerful backend for administrators to manage the ecosystem efficiently.

This project was built from the ground up using a "vanilla" front-end stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), ensuring it remains lightweight, performant, and highly maintainable. For its backend, AgriPortal leverages the power and scalability of **Google Firebase**, utilizing **Firestore** for a real-time NoSQL database and **Firebase Authentication** for secure, role-based user management.

### Our Mission
* **To Empower Farmers:** By providing direct, transparent access to information that can significantly improve their livelihood and agricultural practices.
* **To Drive Efficiency:** By digitizing and streamlining the application process for government schemes, drastically reducing paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles.
* **To Foster Transparency:** By creating a clear, trackable system that gives both farmers and administrators a real-time view of the application lifecycle.

## ‚ú® Key Features

AgriPortal is divided into two primary roles, each with a dashboard and set of features tailored to their specific needs.

### For Farmers (`role: 'farmer'`)

* üîê **Secure Authentication**: Simple, secure registration and login.
* üìä **Personalized Dashboard**: A dynamic and responsive main page featuring:
    * **Live Notifications** from administrators.
    * **Daily Insights Card** with simulated weather for their region and current market prices for their crops of interest.
    * **AI-Powered Recommendations** for schemes based on their profile and crop interests.
* üåø **Crop Information Hub**: A detailed, searchable database of various crops, including optimal growing seasons, suitable regions, and recommended fertilizers/pesticides.
* üí∞ **Scheme Discovery**: A dedicated section to browse and search for available government schemes, with clear details on eligibility, benefits, and application deadlines.
* üìù **Simplified Application Process**: An intuitive, multi-step form to apply for schemes. The form is pre-filled with the farmer's data to minimize manual entry.
* üìà **Live Application Tracking**: A clean, sortable table where farmers can view the real-time status (`Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`) of every application they have submitted.

### For Administrators (`role: 'admin'`)

* üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Admin Access**: A separate, secure login for platform administrators.
* üìà **Centralized Overview**: A powerful admin dashboard with key metrics at a glance:
    * Totals for users, crops, and active schemes.
    * A visual bar chart providing an immediate overview of application statuses.
* üìã **Application Management**: The ability to review, approve, or reject farmer applications in real-time. Changes are instantly reflected in the farmer's dashboard.
* üë• **User Management**: A complete list of all registered farmers, with the ability to search by name or email and manage their status on the platform.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Full Content Control**: Intuitive forms that allow admins to easily add new crop information and government schemes to the platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack & Architecture

This project uses a modern, lightweight, and scalable technology stack, chosen for its performance and developer-friendly experience.

### Technologies Used

| Category | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Front-End** | `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)` |
| **Styling** | `Tailwind CSS` |
| **Backend & DB** | `Google Firebase` (Firestore, Authentication) |
| **Deployment** | `Netlify` |
| **Icons** | `Font Awesome` |

### Architecture

The application follows a **client-side rendered (CSR)** architecture. The front-end is built with vanilla JavaScript, organized into ES6 modules for better code structure and separation of concerns.

* **`main.js`**: Acts as the main controller, handling routing and rendering the correct views.
* **`auth.js`**: Manages all interactions with Firebase Authentication.
* **`data.js`**: Serves as the data layer, encapsulating all Firestore read/write operations.
* **`farmer.js` / `admin.js`**: Contain the logic for rendering the respective user dashboards.
* **`ui.js`**: Provides reusable UI components like modals and toasts.
* **Firebase Backend**: The application communicates directly with Firebase services, which handle the database, user authentication, and security rules, eliminating the need for a traditional server-side application.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Setup)

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser and a code editor like VS Code.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/jenishpatel/farmer-scheme portal](https://github.com/jenishpatel/farmer-scheme-portal.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd farmer-scheme-portal
    ```
3.  **Create your Firebase Configuration:**
    * In the `js/` folder, create a new file named `config.js`.
    * This file is **intentionally ignored by Git** to keep your API keys secure.
    * Add your Firebase project configuration to `js/config.js`:
        ```javascript
        // js/config.js
        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
        };
        ```
4.  **Launch the Application:**
    * Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. A live server extension in your code editor is recommended for the best experience.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for **Continuous Deployment** on **Netlify**.

* **Production Branch**: `main`
* **Build Command**: (None, as it's a static site)
* **Publish Directory**: `.`

### Environment Variables

The production API keys are **not** stored in the repository. They are configured as **environment variables** in the Netlify project settings. A script injected by Netlify at build time makes these keys available to the live application, ensuring a secure deployment.
